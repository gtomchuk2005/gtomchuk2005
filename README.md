### Hi There!

# :postbox: About Me
My name is Greg and I am currently studying Computer Science!

I have been interested in coding since high school. It began with taking AP CSA which taught me the basics of Java, and from there I began self-studying Python, web development, databases, and AI/ML. I am now studying to achieve a Computer Science degree. I hope to become a software engineer in the future - preferably in fullstack development.
